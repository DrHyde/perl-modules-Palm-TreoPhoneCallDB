This module parses the PhoneCallDB database generated on Palm Treos.

To install, do the usual dance:
    less Makefile.PL
    less lib/Palm/TreoPhoneCallDB.pm
    less t/*
those being to ensure that I'm not being evil.

then do this to install the module:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install (you may need to do this as root)
